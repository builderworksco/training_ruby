# Sorting a list from a file

In the file `exercises/data/albums.md` is a list of my favorite albums.

Create a Ruby script that does the following:

-[x] Reads in the file `albums.md`
-[x] Alphabetize the list of albums
-[x] Capitalize all "title words" (i.e. not "is", "the", "a", etc)
-[x] Stores the alphabetized and capitalized list to a new file called `sorted_albums.txt`
-[x] Outputs the message: `n items sorted` with `n` replaced by the count of items
