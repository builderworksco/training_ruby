# Sorting a list from a file

In the file `exercises/data/albums.md` is a list of my favorite albums.

Create a Ruby script that does the following:

- [ ] Reads in the file `albums.md`
- [ ] Alphabetize the list of albums
- [ ] Capitalize all "title words" (i.e. not "is", "the", "a", etc)
- [ ] Stores the alphabetized and capitalized list to a new file called `sorted_albums.txt`
- [ ] Outputs the message: `n items sorted` with `n` replaced by the count of items
